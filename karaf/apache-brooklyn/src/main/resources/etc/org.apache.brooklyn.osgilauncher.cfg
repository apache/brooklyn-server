# This file temporarily contains boot settings for brooklyn karaf launcher,
# matching some of the command-line options of the previous brooklyn-cli launcher
# (those used during the initialization sequence)
#
# Most of these will migrate to a permanent cfg file, once the components themselves get refactored
# and the configuration options are agreed upon

# Location of the global brooklyn.properties file
#globalBrooklynPropertiesFile=~/.brooklyn/brooklyn.properties

# Location of the local brooklyn.properties file, normally specified at the cli. Overrides properties from the global set.

# The high availability mode. Possible values are:
# - DISABLED: management node works in isolation - will not cooperate with any other standby/master nodes in management plane;
# - AUTO: will look for other management nodes, and will allocate itself as standby or master based on other nodes' states;
# - MASTER: will startup as master - if there is already a master then fails immediately;
# - STANDBY: will start up as lukewarm standby with no state - if there is not already a master then fails immediately,
#   and if there is a master which subsequently fails, this node can promote itself;
# - HOT_STANDBY: will start up as hot standby in read-only mode - if there is not already a master then fails immediately,
#   and if there is a master which subseuqently fails, this node can promote itself;
# - HOT_BACKUP: will start up as hot backup in read-only mode - no master is required, and this node will not become a master
#highAvailabilityMode=DISABLED

# The persistence mode. Possible values are:
# - DISABLED: will not read or persist any state;
# - AUTO: will rebind to any existing state, or start up fresh if no state;
# - REBIND: will rebind to the existing state, or fail if no state available;
# - CLEAN: will start up fresh (removing any existing state)
