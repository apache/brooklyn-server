## Join the Community
If it’s your first contribution or it’s a particularly big or complex contribution, things typically go much more smoothly when they start off with a conversation. Significant changes are normally discussed on the mailing list in any case, sometimes with a [feature proposal](https://drive.google.com/drive/#folders/0B3XurVLRa7pIUHNFV3NuVVRkRlE/0B3XurVLRa7pIblN4NGRNN2dYUGM/0B3XurVLRa7pIMlZQSUxrdTh4Wmc) document.

Visit our [Community](https://brooklyn.apache.org/developers/index.html) page to see how to contact Brooklyners via IRC or email.

Create an Issue in Jira
The first step is usually to create or find an issue in [Brooklyn’s Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BROOKLYN) for your feature request or fix. For small changes this isn’t necessary, but it’s good to see if your change fixes an existing issue anyway.
